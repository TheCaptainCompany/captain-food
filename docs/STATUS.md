## 🌐 Deployment

| Piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Render web service (Docker, Frankfurt) | ✅ | Blueprint IaC (`render.yaml`), cargo-chef cached build, verified live |
| Supabase Postgres (Frankfurt, eu-central-1) | ✅ | Session pooler; Data API off (intentional) |
| CI `codegen-consistency` (build+test+validate+drift) | ✅ | Gates deploys (`autoDeployTrigger: checksPass`) |
| CI `db-migrate` (sqlx-cli, gated on green build) | ✅ | Applies `migrations/*.sql` out-of-band (ADR-0043) |
| `/health` (schema-version readiness), `/ping`, `/projector` | ✅ | `>=` version gate; in-process projector |
| GraphQL `/{role}/graphql` + `/{role}/voyager` | ✅ | Role-as-path; per-role filtered schema |
| Custom domains `*.captain.food` (Dynadot wildcard → Render) + Host router | ✅ | Wildcard TLS issued; apex+`www` 301→`join` (GitHub Pages); `hosts.rs` dispatches audiences (`live`/`restos`/`riders`/`system`) + `{slug}` tenants; onrender URL disabled. Recorded in **ADR-0036 amendment (2026-07-18) + ADR-0042** |

## 📖 Read side (queries)

| Query | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `restaurants` / `restaurant` | ✅ | Real data once SIRENE runs |
| `prospectionPipeline` | ✅ | Admin; fed by SIRENE registrations |
| `pricingPolicy` / `uberEstimationPolicy` / `uberSplitPolicy` | ✅ | **Real seeded data** |
| `catalog` / `categories` / `carts` / `cart` / `orders` / `order` | ✅ wired | Empty until the write side emits their events |
| `me` / `favoriteRestaurants` | 🚧 | Identity now available (ADR-0047 `Principal` in ctx); resolver wiring pending |
| Projection worker → registry (per-aggregate checkpoints) | ✅ | In-process |

## ✍️ Write side (mutations)

| Piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MutationRoot` (all api.yaml mutations generated) | ✅ | |
| Restaurant aggregate (13 commands) | ✅ | Spec invariants (event-stream rehydration) + 25 behaviour tests |
| Cart (3) · Order (11) · DeliveryJob (4) | ✅ | Round 2a — real invariants + 29 behaviour tests; some Cart line-checks await a Catalog offer read port |
| Catalog (12) · Prospect (3) · RestaurantAccount (3) | ✅ | Round 2b — real invariants + behaviour tests |
| Customer (14) | 🚧 | Handlers + tests done; needs `AuthProviderGateway` stand-in + a Customer read model injected at the composition root (in progress) |
| `placeOrder` (checkout saga) | 🚧 | Handler + `PaymentGateway` port ready; mutation stubbed until the Stripe integration + PlaceOrderProcess saga land (payment legs are inbound webhooks) |
| Structured typed errors (vs interim `"Code: detail"`) | 📋 | ADR-0046 follow-up |

## 🔐 Authorization

| Piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Per-role ACL — execution guard + per-role introspection/Voyager | ✅ | Spec-derived from api.yaml `roles` (ADR-0006); role now **verified** by JWT (ADR-0047), so Voyager filtering is trustworthy |
| Per-field ACL on FK-derived nav edges | 📋 | api.yaml has **op-level** `roles` only; needs a DSL extension → **plan mode** |
| EXTERNAL machine callers | ✅ | Pre-shared `X-External-Api-Key` (`EXTERNAL_API_TOKENS`, constant-time) or Supabase JWT w/ captain_role EXTERNAL (ADR-0047) |
| Authentication / identity (Supabase JWT) | ✅ | **First cut shipped (ADR-0047)**: verify Supabase JWT via JWKS at `/{role}/graphql` (public keys, no shared secret; ~1h cache, serve-stale-on-refresh-failure — no per-request Supabase call); `app_metadata.captain_role` gates the path (`/public` open, else 401/403), fail-closed on cold cache, asymmetric-only. Verified role + `Principal` injected. **EXTERNAL service tokens** via `X-External-Api-Key` (constant-time, `EXTERNAL_API_TOKENS`) shipped. Per-field `@auth` on FK-nav edges = DSL/plan-mode follow-up |

## 🔎 SIRENE prospection (ADR-0019/0020/0027/0045)

| Piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SIRENE ACL (INSEE → RegisterRestaurant mapping) | ✅ | Unit + DB verified |
| Interim direct-write `sirene_sync` binary | ✅ | **Retired** (ADR-0045) — replaced by the split below |
| `external_sirene_restaurants` staging table | ✅ | Migration applied by CI |
| Thin CI ingestion crate `sirene_ingest` (fetch → UPSERT raw rows, France-wide by department, active-only) | ✅ | No domain deps; scheduled workflow builds only this crate |
| On-app `sync_sirene_worker` (ACL on deployed version) + deletion reconciliation | ✅ | Per-row checkpoint; detect-by-absence (21d debounce) + explicit `F`/`C`; NON_PARTNER auto-close, partners flagged; `POST /internal/sirene/drain` (token-gated, fail-closed) |
| `INSEE_API_TOKEN` repo secret | ✅ | Added; SIRENE runs live on deploy (scheduled ingestion → staging → worker) |
| `INTERNAL_TRIGGER_TOKEN` (Render env + repo secret) to enable the CI→worker ping | ⏳ | Optional; without it CI ingests and the worker drains on its own poll loop (`RUN_SIRENE_WORKER`, default on) |

## 🔌 Inbound integrations (webhooks → ACL → events, ADR-20260718-145856)

| Piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe** `POST /webhooks/stripe` | ✅ | `Stripe-Signature` HMAC verify over raw body (constant-time, 300s replay window, fail-closed); ACL maps `payment_intent.succeeded`/`.payment_failed`/`charge.refunded` → `PaymentCaptured`/`PaymentFailed`/`PaymentRefunded`; idempotent by Stripe event id (`StripeEvent-<id>` stream). 12 unit tests |
| Checkout must set `metadata.restaurantId` (+`orderId`) on the PaymentIntent/charge | 📋 | Else `charge.refunded` is unmappable (logged + 200-ACKed). Lands with `placeOrder` |
| **HubRise** `POST /webhooks/hubrise` | 📋 | Next adapter — auth + ACL → `OfferStockUpdated`/`ImportCatalog` |

## 👤 Pending user actions

- ⏳ *(optional)* Set `INTERNAL_TRIGGER_TOKEN` on the Render service **and** as a repo secret to let the CI ingestion ping the worker for an immediate drain. Not required — the worker polls on its own (`RUN_SIRENE_WORKER`, default on).

## 🧭 Architecture decisions
See [`docs/adr/`](adr/) — latest: 0042 (hosting; +DNS ops note), 0043 (migrations), 0044 (license), 0045 (SIRENE redesign), 0046 (write side), 0047 (API auth — Supabase JWT/JWKS), 0036 amendment (realized DNS + host router, 2026-07-18). **ADR ids are now date-time** to avoid concurrent-session collisions (ADR-20260718-135417).
