# Status journal — 2026-W36

Journal entries for ISO week 2026-W36, newest first, in the order they were written.
Current state: [`../STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md).

> **2026-08-31 — the founder ruled on the credit balance that outlives its erased subject: it is
> disposed of as a LEG of the erasure, never a park.**
> ([ADR-20260831-033621](../adr/ADR-20260831-033621-customer-credit-is-disposed-of-as-a-leg-of-erasure-goodwill-credit-is-refundable.md),
> register row [CREDIT-AT-ERASURE](../decisions/CREDIT-AT-ERASURE.yaml), six lenses.) Directive:
> **refund credit traceable to a captured payment, forfeit purely promotional credit, disclose the
> balance at the confirmation step before the irreversible act.** **Escheat** and
> **block-until-zero** both rejected — escheat invents an unowned-funds posture we have no basis
> for, block-until-zero makes a legal right hostage to a marketing balance. Three rulings on the
> branches the directive did not have: **D1 → A**, reclamation **goodwill credit is REFUNDABLE** —
> the third category, and **100% of the credit that can exist at V0** — to the **original captured
> instrument**, capped at the **un-refunded remainder of that capture** (a full refund plus a
> goodwill grant on one claim otherwise pays €35 against a €30 sale). **D2 → A**, forfeiture is a
> rule of **ACCOUNT TERMINATION GENERALLY** — closure, dormancy, the existing one-year expiry and
> erasure alike — because **Art. 12(5)** requires exercising a right to be free of charge and a
> balance extinguished *because* someone asked to be erased is arguable as a charge. **D3 → A**, a
> **failed refund PROCEEDS AND IS RECORDED**: the erasure completes on the **Art. 12(3) clock**, the
> failure lands on the pseudonymous receipt, the amount becomes an ordinary payable — the founder's
> own objection to block-until-zero, applied consistently.
>
> **What the record explicitly does NOT close.** **D4** (does the credit leg ship inside
> [#708](https://github.com/TheCaptainCompany/captain-food/issues/708) or after), **D5** (shorten
> the expiry to ~180 days so *traceable* implies *refundable* by construction) and **D6** (which pot
> drains first when credit is spent — **free only until a promotional grant exists**) are **open**,
> and need keys the coordinator declares. **The three counsel questions on
> [#764](https://github.com/TheCaptainCompany/captain-food/issues/764) are NOT discharged**: legal's
> verdict is **0 discharged, 1 narrowed, 2 untouched**, and **Q2 is now heavier** — both limbs of
> D1/D2 produce an accounting movement someone may have to prove, so "is the credit ledger
> L123-22-retained or shreddable?" now covers more of the ledger, not less. `decided` is a recorded
> founder decision and **not legal clearance**.
>
> **Four lens findings verified against the tree rather than taken on the card's word.**
> `CustomerCreditGranted` carries `customerId`/`amount`/`reclamationId` and **no provenance field**
> (`specs/payments/events.yaml:184-195`) — so the refund/forfeit split is a **stored-event-shape
> change**, and the disclosure block is **absent, not zero**, at V0 (ux). It also carries **no
> `legalRetention:` marker** while `PaymentCaptured` and `PaymentRefunded` both carry the 10-year
> one (`:41`, `:141`) — and the refund arm **creates a new 10-year retained record naming the
> subject as part of erasing them**, which must appear in `retainedUnder` (legal).
> `CustomerCreditBalanceRow` is `customer_id`/`balance_cents`/`currency`/timestamps
> (`crates/application/src/generated/rows.rs:181-187`), so beck's prediction is exact: a classifier
> handed that row applies a **default to 100% of balances**, and `default ⇒ forfeit` silently
> forfeits every refund owed **while every unit test stays green** — the counter-measure is
> compiler-first, a parameter type that row cannot satisfy. And `GrantCustomerCredit` is a `send:`
> step in the PM's own thread (`specs/ordering/processmanager.yaml:259-261`) — **an unlaned
> foreign-stream write on the money path, live today, and not among C3's twelve** (Payment ×7,
> DeliveryJob ×4, Cart ×1).
>
> **The rejected option business had assumed was available is foreclosed by our own design**:
> "let the subject spend the credit first" cannot be offered, because **`re-login-cancels`** means a
> customer who logs in to spend the balance **cancels their own erasure**. Any "use it first" copy
> would be a lie.
>
> Also corrected in the same change: `docs/claude/sessions/environment.md` claimed **executors
> cannot perform GitHub API mutations**. They can — `gh` is absent and MCP is not in a subagent's
> toolset, but `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN"` against `api.github.com` returned `200`
> from this executor. Believing the old sentence makes an executor hand back incomplete work for a
> capability it has.
>
> **Week roll**: this file is new. 2026-08-31 is the **Monday of ISO 2026-W36**, and only
> `journal-2026-W35.md` existed. The budget ledger had already rolled to W36 — which is the trap the
> dispatch named, since inferring the journal's week from the budget file is exactly the wrong
> method; `date +%G-W%V` is the check.
